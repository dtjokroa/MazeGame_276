Instructions of how to build/run/test our game:

To build and run our game, you can download all files or clone our git repository to your own local computer, then import it as an existing maven project, and by typing the command line: <mvn verify>, our game should be successfully built and run properly (including all the tests). Alternitively, you can use the corresponding maven function buttons in your preferred IDE such as Intellij or Eclipse, or simply run our project as a Java application.

The test files for our game are all located in the src/test/java and src/test/resources directories. You can run each unit test and integration test one by one as well. The corresponding results will show up in the JUnit consle window.

If you want to run our JAR file for the game, you can issue the command line: <java -jar group13-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar> in the terminal. To view the javadoc in IDEs, you can use View | Quick Documentation or the corresponding keyboard shortcut (by default: Ctrl+Q on Windows/Linux and Ctrl+J on macOS or F1 in the recent IDE versions) for IntelliJ; or in Eclipse you can hover the mouse over some method or class names in the source editor, then press shortcut Shift-F2 (Open External Documentation) to let javadoc view open the full documentation at the right position.
